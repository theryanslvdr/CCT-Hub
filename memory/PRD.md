## Completed Work (2026-01-11 Session 5 - Latest)

### P0 - User Feedback Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
1. **Fixed License Registration "Field Required" Error**
   - Changed API call from URLSearchParams to FormData (multipart/form-data)
   - Fixed `create_access_token` → `create_token` function name in backend
   - Added `_id` exclusion from MongoDB response to prevent serialization error
   
2. **Removed Notices Below Starting Amount**

5. **Licensee Withdrawals Affect Master Admin Balance**

     - Master Admin's balance (since licensee funds are tied to master admin)
   - Same logic for deposits - both balances increase
